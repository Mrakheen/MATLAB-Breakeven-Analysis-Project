Background:

A local zoo, thanks to a new breeding program for endangered species, has successfully birthed two new,
healthy elephants. The zoo will spend several years preparing these elephants to be released into the
wild. While they are preparing these elephants for their eventual release, the zoo has noticed an increase
in attention for these beautiful creatures. In order to expand revenue for their breeding program to include
other endangered species, they have plans to create a new enclosure area so the elephants can play and
grow, while visitors observe them. The zoo asks your company specifically to provide a program that can
perform a breakeven analysis on the different materials and construction methods, and determine the
expected return on investment. This analysis will aid in predicting what other species can be added using
the profit from this new enclosure. Specifically, your program must consider construction costs (fixed
costs), various operational costs (variable costs), and the revenue dependent on interest level of the
public.
